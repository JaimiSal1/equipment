When I was fifteen. I went to a Boarding High School in Michigan. And we had a transfer kid. From Columbine. 
I knew this girl. Or I thought I did. She was great. But what I didn’t know, was what she’d been through.
Until she gave a speech about it, at our general assembly. About hiding from those boys in the cafeteria. About hearing the shots. About losing friends.
It was a simple speech, about the need to be kind to each other. I remember, at the time, I would never have thought... I mean, it seemed like a freak incident. A weird and crazy thing that happened.
Just this one horrible unrepeatable time. Did you watch the CNN town hall, between Dana Loesch and the Parkland kids? It broke me. The absolute disconnect. Between this NRA spokesperson, who just kept spewing these idiotic talking points,
and these traumatized, angry, devastated kids. I didn’t know what to do. But I thought, I’m an adult. And adults are supposed to protect children. So I thought... I’d write about this.  I’d write about a town... wrestling with this. See if we can move past the talking points.
And past our denial. Our massive, incomprehensible denial, as a culture, that we have such a real problem with violence. I made up Sheila. “My name is Sheila Marker. And I will stop at nothing.” I went and shot a bunch of guns, for this, to try to understand. In Pennsylvania. I went to a shooting range. And I tried it out.
